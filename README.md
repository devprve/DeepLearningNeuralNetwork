# DeepLearningNeuralNetwork


a) you create a 3 layer neural network versus what colab does (at most 2 layer)

b) you must use tensorflow einsum instead of matrix multiply you see in colab.

--- DeepLearning1 

 Use 3 variables based non linear equation (the example i gave in class goes to  2 variables -https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r0u-mOhrkDMRXkd4g2wgtbudZ2VCmCE0N3pTgTDWSw0/edit#slide=id.gbb803640d1_0_76 . Generate synthetic data using the equation you used and plot using 4d plot
 
 --- DeepLearning1-4D

a) Write  a colab  numpy only from scratch 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression . Use proper non linear activation functions and proper number of hidden layer neurons - show the results / loss and epochs training and final output . You will be doing manual backprop and chain rule based gradient propagation

b) Write a colab pytorch from scratch - 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression withotu using pytorch builtin layer functionality 

---- DeepLearning3
 

c) Write  a colab pytorch classes based - 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression using pytorch builtin functionality of modules etc.,. backprop etc.,.

d) Write  a colab  pytorch lightening version of the same

 ---- DeepLearning5

e) 

Build the same using Tensorflow various variants low level, api, functional, model, builtin 


 ---- DeepLearning6
 


Write  a colab  tensorflow only from scratch not using high level api  of the same

 ---- DeepLearning7

Write a colab tensorflow only with builtin layers of the same


 ---- DeepLearning8

 Write a colab with Use functional api high level api  of tensorflow for the same

 ---- DeepLearning8.1
 

Write a colab with tensorflow only but using high level api

  ---- DeepLearning9


h) repeat the above using JAX.

 ---- DeepLearningJAX
 
 Alternatively I have described the problem statement in the beginning of each colab.
